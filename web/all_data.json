    "I've been struggling with the idea of love and was hoping to get a perspective on some thoughts. Bhakta means love, but love is always talked about as if there are different forms but I don't see it that way. Love is love to me. Not family love, romantic love, friendship love.. The only difference is, are the relationships that dictate the expression and the strength. But is the love different? Can you love someone or something with no relationship? Can you have a relationship with no love? Everywhere I turn there's this idea of different love but is there different hate? So far I've come to the idea that when you're allowed to be completely your true self with no added conflict, comparison or judgment then it is an environment to allow your love to shine and the ones who allow it are loved ones. Do these teachings have anything to say about these ideas?",
